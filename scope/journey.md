# The Inevitability of a Dynamic Medium

Once upon a time, people used paper to communicate.

Every day, they would write or print documents on paper and send them using
physical postal mail, only to read them and throw them away afterwards.

Because of that, even when email became ubiquitous, people would email pdf
documents, which just imitated the static paper medium on a screen.

Because of that, there was a lot of waste, both in trash and also in time.  It
was hard for information to be extracted and used in novel ways.

Until finally, everyone alive had never known a world without the internet and a
computer in their pocket, everything became digitized in a way that was machine
readable, and the world embraced the information-dense, dynamic medium, finally
breaking free of the static paper medium that came before it.
