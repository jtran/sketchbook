Astronomers have the telescope.

Biologists have the microscope.

What do software engineers have?

I propose a scope for inspecting the runtime state of software systems.

### History

This directory is an umbrella for multiple projects with several incarnations
and re-writes over the years, all with the same theme.

[machina](https://github.com/jtran/machina) is one of the earlier incarnations,
but not the first.

Over the years, I've written projects in C++, OCaml, JavaScript, Java, Rust,
and most recently, CoffeeScript.
